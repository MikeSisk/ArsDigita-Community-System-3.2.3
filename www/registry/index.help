the Stolen Equipment Registry

<hr>

The stolen equipment registry at photo.net is a place for crime
victims to record serial numbers of cameras that they've had stolen.
If you're offered used camera equipment, you can search by serial
number to see if any items have been reported stolen by photo.net
users.
