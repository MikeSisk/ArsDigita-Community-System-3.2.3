This directory, /education/users/ is used by both
the /class/admin/users/ directory and
the /department/admin/users/ directory.  It has
been combined in to one section because the code is
virtually identical and it does not make sense to 
put it in two separate places.


The pages are served using ns_register_proc
on the previously mentioned directories.
