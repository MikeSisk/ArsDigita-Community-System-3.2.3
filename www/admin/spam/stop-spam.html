<h2>Stopping and starting a mailing</h2>

To stop the mail going out, click on the "disable spam email sending" link on the
<a href=index.tcl>Spam Admin homepage</a>.

<p>

To make sure a mailing doesn't get restarted when the server restarts,
set it to the "sent" state, by clicking on the mailing in the
calendar, and selecting the state manually on its web page.
<p>
To restart a mailing:
<ul>
<li> Set the message to the "interrupted" state manually
<li> Re-enable the email sending, from the spam admin page
<li> The spam daemon will resume within twenty minutes or so, or you
can force the spam daemon to run the queue by clicking on the "force daemon to run the queue" link on the admin page.
</ul>
