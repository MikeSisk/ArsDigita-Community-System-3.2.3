Changes to the original code made by David Rodriguez (dvr@arsdigita.com).
   (Note: Some of the line numbers below are no longer 
   accurate since I changed the code).

1) Modified returncode.tcl and returncodeall.tcl to create 
directories if they don't exist before saving code.

2) I think line 595 in tableinfo-3.tcl was unneeded. It printed
a "" to the screen. Commented out the line  {ns_write \""}

3) solicit_info would say "Please enter the the prompt text..." 
(notice the two copies of "the"). Fixed.

4) There were some TEXTAREAS with empty space between <TEXTAREA> and 
</TEXTAREA>. Removed those.

5) In code_for_textbox, a small textbox (SIZE=10) wouldn't be enclosed
with <TD>'s. Fixed.

6) Add an extra space after the # in the list of needed variables.
Fixed line 351, 759, 572, 632 in tableinfo3.tcl

7) modified a bunch of the code so it would have spaces where we 
want the (so the resulting HTML would look nicer)

8) Modified returncode.tcl and returncodeall.tcl to overwrite
any files in the way.

9) Changed the $backlink stuff. Now uses the Yahoo-style navbar.

10) created a proc max_col_length that queries the database
to determine the maximum allowed length for a column. We use
this information to set the MAXLENGTH of any INPUT TYPE=TEXT ..
box. Used in handle_textbox and code_for_textbox. Added some upvar's
in other procs so these functions can get access to $table_name

11) on add-2.tcl and edit-2.tcl, added pieces of code
that checks to see if variables are too long. I don't know
how to determine if the variable coming in is coming from a TEXTAREA,
so I check the maximum length of the column, and if it's longer
than 200, assume that it's coming from a textarea, and therefore
needs to be checked.

12) Killed the form at the top of tableinfo-3.tcl that led
to the edit pages. Wasn't needed.
