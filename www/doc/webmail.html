<h3>The big picture</h3>

In the beginning, email would get sent to your big Unix box and
delivered to a central mail queue, where you would pick it up from
time to time with your mail reader and store it permanently in your
home directory somewhere. You telnetted to the machine, used your
favorite mail reader, all your mail was available from one place, it
got backed up every night along with everything else on the machine,
and life was good.

<p>

Then along came POP. Mail was sent to your big Unix box where it got
delivered to a central mail queue, from where you would pick it up
from time to time with your mail reader. Only now, it would get stored
on whatever machine you happened to be at the time that you decided to
read it. You could tell it to keep all the mail on the server, but
then every time you read your email, you would see things you'd
already seen before, even mail you had deleted elsewhere. If you
didn't tell it to keep your mail on the server it would get deleted as
soon as you picked it up, and the only copy would be on your desktop
machine or your laptop, with no backups whatsoever.

<p>

IMAP was invented to address this problem, giving both the benefits of
POP along with the centralized mail reading convenience of the
old-school style of doing things. True, probably your favorite mail
reader didn't support IMAP just yet, but you could get by with what
was available, and more readers were adding support all the
time. Still, you might be stuck somewhere without a readily available
IMAP client, and in today's hostile net environment, telnetting to the
server in the clear is a no-no. This is where web-based email
shines. Constant access to your email store wherever you may be, as
long as a web browser is available. Combined with an IMAP interface to
the same store, you can have the benefits of both worlds, and be
almost as happy as when you were telnetting to your mail server.

<p>

This architecture is available today. You can sign up for an account
at criticalpath.net, and they will set you up with an IMAP and
web-based email account. You can install Oracle email server from a CD
and get the same thing. Why yet another system? Ease of modification
and flexibility. If you find yourself missing a feature from Critical
Path's system that you would dearly love, you can request it of them
and they might deign to provide it in the indeterminate future. You
may or may not be able to modify the Oracle email system to your
particular needs, but I wouldn't know as I haven't been able to figure
out how it works. This module is flexible, easy to extend, and easy to
understand. Or if not, at least all the source is there for you to
look at.

<h3>Architecture</h3>

As far as possible, I've tried to avoid getting into implementing
systems that have been done well before. That means no reinventing of
mail software; no implementing of IMAP or SMTP protocols; no worrying
about file locking and mail delivery. <a
href="http://www.qmail.org/">qmail</a> and the UW IMAP server were
written years ago by people who dedicated lots of effort to make sure
they were done correctly. This module doesn't even look at email until
it has been delivered by qmail as it would be to any user.

<p>

Once the mail has been delivered, it is parsed and inserted into
Oracle by some Java code running inside Oracle. Using a relational
database as the message store has many benefits. It provides a
standard data model for multiple interfaces to hook up to. It makes it
easy to do the web interface. It is fast and scalable. It makes
implementing powerful email search facilities easy. Using Java lets us
leverage the JavaMail API to do the hard work of parsing the
messages. It also has the benefit of tight integration to Oracle
through the JServer JSQL interface. For example, messages are read
into a CLOB column by being streamed from the file system in bite
sized chunks. If we were using, say, a perl DBI program to do the
insertion, we would have to read the entire message into memory before
writing it to the CLOB. With multi-megabyte emails becoming more
common in today's media-rich environment, this has obvious benefits.

<p>

On the front end, we provide a more or less traditional ACS web module
for the web-based front end, and an Oracle "driver" (mail store
hookup) for the UW IMAP server to provide the IMAP interface (not yet
written).


<h4>Receiving Mail</h4>

The webmail module interfaces with qmail to receive mail. All of the
heavy lifting involved in getting email delivered reliably and in a
standards-conformant manner is done by qmail.

<p>

The webmail system defines <i>domains</i> and <i>email accounts</i>. A
domain is defined by a host name and a short string to be able to
refer to it easily. The full domain name must correspond to a virtual
domain that qmail is set up to receive email for. In the following,
let us assume that "webmail.arsdigita.com" is the full domain name and
"wm" is the short name.

<ul>
<li>Set up DNS so that the full domain name resolves to the host on
which you are setting up this system (or set up an appropriate MX
record).

<li>Add a line consisting of the full domain name to
/var/qmail/control/rcpthosts so that qmail knows to receive email for
this domain.

<li>Select a name for an email account that will be used to handle all
the email for this system. This can be arbitrary, so we will just use
"webmail" (if you want to use something else, you must edit the Java code).

<li>Create a virtual user by adding the following line to /var/qmail/users/assign:
<pre>
+webmail-:oracle:101:102:/home/nsadmin/qmail/alias:-::
</pre>
This says any email intended for "webmail-*@webmail.arsdigita.com"
will be handled by the Unix user "oracle" (uid 101, gid 102) according
to the alias files in the directory /home/nsadmin/qmail/alias. Make
sure that directory exists, and can be written to by the nsadmin user:
<pre>
(as root):
mkdirhier /home/nsadmin/qmail/alias
chown nsadmin /home/nsadmin/qmail/alias
</pre>
The location of this alias directory can be changed by setting the
AliasDirectory parameter in the webmail section of the ACS .ini file
for this server.

<li>Run /var/qmail/bin/qmail-newu to have the previous change take effect.

<li>Add the following to /var/qmail/control/virtualdomains:
<pre>
webmail.arsdigita.com:webmail-wm
</pre>

This tells qmail that any mail sent to "*@webmail.arsdigita.com" will
be handled by the webmail virtual user, and have "-wm" appended to the
username portion of the email address. So, mail sent to
"foo@webmail.arsdigita.com" will be delivered to the webmail user as
"webmail-wm@webmail.arsdigita.com".

<li>Register this domain with the webmail system by using the
administration pages, with (again, just for this example) "wm" as the
short name and "webmail.arsdigita.com" as the domain name. (You will
need to load the data model file to do this, which requires that the
Java libraries be loaded, see below).

<li>Create a queue directory for deliveries to the webmail user. Make
sure it is writable and readable by the oracle Unix account (or
whatever user Oracle runs at):
<pre>
(as root:)
/var/qmail/bin/maildirmake /home/nsadmin/qmail/queue
chown -R oracle /home/nsadmin/qmail/queue
</pre>
The location of the queue directory can be changed by setting the
QueueDirectory parameter in webmail section of the ACS .ini file for
this server.
</ul>

<p>

Once the domain has been set up, you can start adding email
accounts. An email account is tied to an ACS user; an ACS user can
receive email at any number of different accounts, on any domains that
this host receives email for. Once received, they are treated
identically, and are indistinguishable other than from the email
headers. Email accounts can be assigned to users by using the
administration pages.

<p>

When an email account is added, a file is created automatically in the
alias directory of the form ".qmail-[short domain name]-username"
(e.g., ".qmail-wm-jsc") that contains one line with the full path to
the queue directory (/home/nsadmin/qmail/queue/). This file specifies
that mail sent to "webmail-wm-jsc@webmail.arsdigita.com" be delivered
to the maildir directory that we have set up. All email to be handled
by the webmail system ends up in the same place
(/home/nsadmin/qmail/queue/new). The system uses the RFC822
Delivered-To header to distinguish who it should be displayed to. The
indirection through the .qmail alias files is done so that only email
sent to valid accounts will be received. Email sent to an address that
does not have a .qmail file set up for it will bounce normally.

<p>

Once every minute, Oracle polls the new directory of the maildir queue
and picks up any mail that has been delivered. Using the JavaMail
library running inside Oracle, it stores and parses the message, and
saves off various pieces of information (parsed headers, attachments,
etc.; see the <a
href="/doc/sql/display-sql.tcl?url=/doc/sql/webmail.sql">data
model</a>).

<p>

To install the Java portion of this module, download the JavaMail
library from <a
href="http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/">http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/</a>
and the JavaBeans Activation Framework from <a
href="http://java.sun.com/beans/glasgow/jaf.html">http://java.sun.com/beans/glasgow/jaf.html</a>.
Unpack the distributions and load activation.jar and mail.jar into Oracle:
<pre>
loadjava -user dbuser/dbpasswd -resolve -verbose activation.jar
loadjava -user dbuser/dbpasswd -resolve -verbose mail.jar
</pre>
(You may get a verification warning attempting to resolve
javax/activation/ActivationDataFlavor which you can ignore.) The
database user must have been granted the JAVASYSPRIV role.

<p>

Then load the various Java files in the /webmail/java directory:

<pre>
loadjava -user dbuser/dbpasswd -resolve -verbose BlobDataSource.java ClobDataSource.java MessageParser.sqlj MessageComposer.sqlj
</pre>
Make sure you create the PL/SQL bindings in the data model file and
create the job which will poll the mail queue.

<p>

To test that you are receiving mail properly, send a message to
user@full_domain_name. A new file should immediately be created in
/home/nsadmin/qmail/queue/new. If one does not appear, check out the
qmail error logs (usually /var/log/qmail/current) to see what the
problem might be. If you have started the polling job, the file should
disappear in less than a minute, and the message should be waiting in
the user's INBOX.

<h4>Reading Email</h4>

The web interface should be self-explanatory and documented with Help
links. The IMAP interface isn't yet written, so there is no
documentation for it.
