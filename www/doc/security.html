<h2>Security in ACS</h2>

<h3>Chrooted AOLserver</h3>

In order to limit the amount of damage someone exploiting a security
hole in ACS can do, it is possible to run AOLserver in a chroot
environment (see <a
href="http://www.aolserver.com/documentation/3.0/admin/sec-ch2.htm#8704">http://www.aolserver.com/documentation/3.0/admin/sec-ch2.htm#8704</a>). The
tricky part to doing this is setting up a root directory that will let
the Oracle driver find all the files it needs to work.

<h3>Setting up the chroot directory</h2>

In order to keep things simple, we'll use the server directory as the
new root (let's call it <code>/home/aolserver</code>). We need to recreate
a few system directories and populate them:

<pre>
cd /home/aolserver
mkdir bin dev etc tmp usr var

# Create some device files necessary for Oracle.
# (The following is Solaris specific.)
cd dev
mknod kmem c 13 1
mknod mem c 13 0
mknod zero c 13 12
chmod a+w zero

# Copy necessary files to /etc.
cd ../etc
cp /etc/group /etc/hosts /etc/nsswitch.conf /etc/resolv.conf /etc/netconfig .
grep nsadmin /etc/passwd > passwd

# Create a symlink as /home/aolserver, so we don't have to edit all our
# .ini files.
cd ..
mkdir home
ln -s . home/aolserver

# Make tmp directory world writable.
chmod 1777 tmp 
mkdir var/tmp
chmod 1777 var/tmp

# Copy rm to bin.
cp /bin/rm bin

# Copy unzip to usr/bin.
mkdir usr/bin
cp /usr/bin/unzip usr/bin

# Copy shared libraries to usr.
mkdir usr/lib
cp /usr/lib/*.a /usr/lib/*.so.* usr/lib

# If using the ecommerce module with ImageMagick to do image resizing,
# copy ImageMagick files if available.
mkdirhier usr/local/bin
mkdirhier usr/local/lib
cp /usr/local/bin/convert usr/local/bin
cp /usr/local/lib/ImageMagick* usr/local/lib

# Copy timezone files.
mkdirhier usr/share/lib
cp -r /usr/share/lib/zoneinfo usr/share/lib

# The page root must also be within the chroot environment.
mkdir web
mv /web/servername /home/aolserver/web
ln -s /home/aolserver/web/servername /web/servername

# Copy necessary Oracle files to new root.
mkdirhier /home/aolserver$ORACLE_HOME
cd /home/aolserver$ORACLE_HOME
(cd $ORACLE_HOME; tar cf - bin dbs lib network ocommon rdbms) | tar xvf -
</pre>

<h3>Setting up Oracle</h3>

Unfortunately, when running Oracle in dedicated server mode, each
client process starts up its own server process which requires direct
access to the data files. This will obviously not work in a chroot
environment unless all the Oracle data files are contained within the
chroot directory. This is not desirable and generally not possible.

<p>

One workaround for this is to connect to Oracle through a TCP
connection. This is by far the easiest to set up. The downside is that
there is some performance loss going through TCP instead of using IPC.
To do this, edit <code>$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/listener.ora</code>
to add a TCP listener and
<code>$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora</code> to add a network
alias for that listener (see the <a
href="http://oradoc.photo.net/ora81/DOC/network.815/a67440/toc.htm">Net8
Administrator's Guide</a>, or just use netasst). Then have AOLserver
use it by putting the network alias as the <code>Datasource</code>
entry for the connection pool in your server's .ini file.

<p>

If you insist on using IPC, you must configure the database to run in
multi-threaded server (MTS) mode. Configuring MTS mode can be somewhat
tricky (see <a
href="http://oradoc.photo.net/ora81/DOC/server.815/a67772/manproc.htm#1369">this
doc</a>). In brief, you must:
<ul>

<li>add the following to your initSID.ora file:
<pre>
# Configure MTS for IPC connections and start up one server.
mts_dispatchers = "(PROTOCOL = IPC)(DISP=1)(mul=OFF)(pool=OFF)(PRES=TTC)"
mts_max_dispatchers = 5
mts_servers = 1
mts_max_servers = 20
</pre>

<li>Make sure there is an IPC listener configured in listener.ora:
<pre>
LISTENER =
  (DESCRIPTION_LIST =
    (DESCRIPTION =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = IPC)(KEY = EXTPROC))
    )
  )

SID_LIST_LISTENER =
  (SID_LIST =
    (SID_DESC = 
      (SID_NAME = PLSExtProc) 
      (ORACLE_HOME = /ora8/m01/app/oracle/product/8.1.6) 
      (PROGRAM = extproc) 
    ) 
    (SID_DESC = 
      (GLOBAL_DBNAME = ora8) 
      (ORACLE_HOME = /ora8/m01/app/oracle/product/8.1.6) 
      (SID_NAME = ora8) 
    ) 
  )
</pre>

<li>add a network alias to tnsnames.ora:
<pre>
ORA8_IPC =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS_LIST =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = IPC)(KEY = EXTPROC))
    )
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVICE_NAME = ora8)
      (SRVR = SHARED)
    )
  )
</pre>

<li>and use that network alias as the datasource in your server's .ini file.
</ul>

<p>

To put Oracle into MTS mode, you must now restart the Oracle
server. The listener should be started before the server so that the
server can register itself properly with the listener. To verify that
Oracle is in MTS mode, connect to Oracle using "sqlplus
username/password@ora8_ipc" (substitute the network alias you put in
tnsnames.ora for ora8_ipc), and run this SQL statement: <code>select
username, program, server from v$session where
audsid=userenv('sessionid');</code>. It should return "SHARED" in the
SERVER column. If it says "DEDICATED" instead, your server is not in
MTS mode.

<p>

One last problem with running ACS in a chrooted environment is that
Oracle uses Unix domain socket files for IPC that are created in
/var/tmp/.oracle. We must replace /var/tmp/.oracle with a symlink to a
directory underneath the chroot directory. This must only be done with
Oracle shut down!

<pre>
cd /home/aolserver
mkdir var/tmp/.oracle
chown oracle var/tmp/.oracle
chmod 777 var/tmp/.oracle
# Make sure Oracle is not running before you do this next step!
rm -r /var/tmp/.oracle
ln -s /home/aolserver/var/tmp/.oracle /var/tmp/.oracle
</pre>

<p>

A caveat about specifying directories in .ini files: every path must
be relative to the chroot directory (e.g., /home/nsadmin/foo/bar ->
/foo/bar), <i>except</i> for AuxConfigdir, which must be an absolute
path.

<h3>Running AOLserver</h3>

Run AOLserver using <code>/home/aolserver/bin/nsd-oracle -ikc
/home/aolserver/servername.ini -r /home/aolserver</code> from inittab.


<h3>Disk Issues</h3>

Chrooting a server requires that everything related to the running of
AOLserver reside under a single directory. This may cause problems
with disk space, since what before was split up onto two directories
(the server root and the page root) now must go under the same
directory. One workaround is to mount a separate disk as
/home/aolserver/web and symlink it to /web.
