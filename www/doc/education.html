Note: This module and documentation are not yet complete.  We are
releasing it so that people may know what is currently available and
what is coming.  We hope to be making significant improvements to this
module over the next several incremental releases.  We encourage all
forms of feedback.  If there are any features that are not currently
in the system but you would like to see, please feel free to request
them.

<blockquote>

This module implements all the IT needs for a department or university
to organize and administer all of its classes online. Most
importantly, it is tightly integrated with the rest of the ArsDigita
Community System. This enables the site administrator to run a single
Oracle query to "find all users who have taken classes A, B, and C",
then spam them asking if anyone wants to TA a new course.  Or, they can
say "find all students in danger of failing a class", then notify them
of the situation.

<p>

In addition to the standard <a href="bboard.html">bulletin board</a>
and <a href="chat.html">chat room</a> you would expect in any online
educational system, this provides administrators with the ability to
see all information about any student or any group of students at any
given time.  The system provides online homework submission and
grading, automated grade calculation, and the ability to easily
monitor students' performance and participation.  In addition, it
enables instructors to create and manage course Web sites without
having to know HTML or other programming languages.

<p>

The system provides the student with the ability to view all of their
classes and assignments on an integrated schedule.  In addition, it
allows students to easily build a portfolio of their work across
classes.  Students can customize their calendars and work space using
extra tables for the <a href="portals.html">portal system</a>.

<p>

Department administrators can collect statistics about classes they
are offering as well as view information about the students taking
those classes.  

<p>

The education moudle offers these featurs in addition to many other
features detailed in the overview below.

Mention that the permissions for files are hierarchical depending on the sort key
<p>
Also mention that performance will be pathetic on pages the reference fs_files because of the 
user_had_row_permission_p function can cause a full table scan.
